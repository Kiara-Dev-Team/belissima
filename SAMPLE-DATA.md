## Data Generation Logic

The sample data follows these principles:

1. **Realistic Growth Patterns**
   - MoM growth slowing slightly (law of large numbers)
   - Seasonality in Q4 (holiday effects)
   - Compounding effects visible

2. **Metric Relationships**
   - Improving CAC correlates with higher NRR (better customers)
   - Lower churn leads to higher GRR and NRR
   - Expansion grows as customer base matures

3. **Industry Benchmarks**
   - All metrics within realistic ranges for Series B SaaS
   - Rule of 40 achievable but ambitious
   - LTV:CAC healthy but not unrealistic

4. **Story Arc**
   - Company improving over time
   - Operational excellence showing results
   - Path to profitability while maintaining growth

## Using This Data

### For Demos
This data tells a compelling story of a well-run SaaS company:
- Growing efficiently (CAC down, growth maintained)
- Improving retention (churn down 45%)
- Expanding successfully (NRR 115%)
- Reaching profitability (Rule of 40 at 62%)

### For Testing
The data includes:
- Various chart types (lines, bars, gauges)
- Positive and negative values
- Percentages, currency, and ratios
- Time series and cross-sectional data

### For Customization
Replace with your actual data by:
1. Maintaining same data structure
2. Adjusting scales to match your metrics
3. Keeping relationships logical (e.g., NRR ≥ GRR)

**Remember**: This is sample data for demonstration. Your actual metrics will vary based on your business model, stage, and market.
